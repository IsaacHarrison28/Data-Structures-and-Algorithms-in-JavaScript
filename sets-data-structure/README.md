# WHAT ARE SETS

Sets are a type of data structure that allows developers to add unique data to a storage and not replicas of each other. The typical use of a sets data structure is in the collections of an accounts number of followers and following; no single account can follow another account more than once. This means the account holds a unique key in some storage system such as data base that allows the algorithm to detect that the account already follows another and therefore a second follow cannot be executed!
