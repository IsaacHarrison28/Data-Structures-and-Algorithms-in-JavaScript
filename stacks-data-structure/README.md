# INTRO TO STACKS

Stack data structure is one which could be said as a , 'last come, first serve' type of an arrangement. Imagine a box containing books put on top of each other, the last book to be put in the box will be the first one to be removed from the box before reaching the book that was first put into the box. That's the exact visualisation of the stack data structure!

## WHICH JAVASCRIPT FEATURE IMPLEMENTS STACKS ?

In javaScript, an array allows you to easily implement the stack data structure by having methods: pop(), push(), length() and peek()
Looking at push(); a method which allows you to add an element to the end of an array and pop(); a method which allows you to remove an element from the end of an array, you can easily create an algorithm which implements the stack data structure.
Look into the different folders in this stacks-data-structure parent root to see how exactly such algorithms can be created to implement the stack data structure.
