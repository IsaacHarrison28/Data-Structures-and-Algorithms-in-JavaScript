# HOW THE PALINDROME CHECK ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTS STACK DS

To start this, a palindrome could be defined to be a word that has the same spelling when written backwards. In the [algorithm](./script.js) for it's implementation, the firstWord is taken into a loop method and dismatled into separate letters by pushing each index of i into a new array and therefore, as already described in the stacks parent [README](../README.md), an array allows us to carry out stacking methods by default.
The new array now contain individual letters of the first word written in their original order. With these letters in the array, we pop out each last letter in the array and construct the second word from the popped words meaning that, ' the last letters to be pushed into the array now become the first letters to be popped out and used to rewrite the second word. ' From this explanation, we see exactly that at this point, we have implemented the stack data structure; which is said to be a, ' last in, first out ' type of arrangement, and now to complete the palindrome check, we simply check if the second word constructed; which is now the first word  written backwards, is exactly equal to the first word initially written.
