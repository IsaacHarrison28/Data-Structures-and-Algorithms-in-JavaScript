# WHAT ARE DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS

A data structure is a method of organising data that makes it easy to process, retrieve and store that data. An algorithm on the other hand is a collection of logical steps that are meant to carry out a specitic function or solve a particular problem.

## WHAT THIS REPOSITORY IS MEANT TO ACCOMPLISH

Learning data structures and algorithms is not as easy as it may be said to be, it surely does demand alot of practice to finally get ahold of concepts learnt to successively implement in a real world problem. However, this repository is meant to set a basic understanding of these concepts and therefore give you the necessary knowledge to take up a data structure and algorithms question. This does not guarantee that memorising these concepts in this repository will automatically set you ready to succeed in any data structure and algorithm problem but it sure does, with your own efforts and practice, set you on a better path to go on and increase your level of expertise by trying out and learning more algorithms on any platform or source of data structure and algorithms questioning platform of your choice.
